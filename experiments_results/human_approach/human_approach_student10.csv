17:41:57;3;How satisfied were you with the overall design process you experienced?;It was very hard to select the different squares and that took a long time and made it hard to change your design. But other than that it did work very easy

17:41:57;2;Entered Screen;10
17:42:26;2;How easy was it to use the design tools provided?;Just clicking and everything was easy, but not knowing what changed in the design made it very difficult

17:42:44;4;How satisfied are you with the design decisions you made?;Yes, I think it works out with the space layout and how everything looks

17:43:10;0;How do you think having AI assistance would have changed your design process?;Maybe, but I would still go over it again to see if everything is divided how you want it to be

17:43:23;0;Would you choose to use this design process in future projects based on your current experience?;No, the selection made it very diffucult

17:44:13;0;Please provide any additional comments or suggestions on how we could improve the design process used in this experiment.;Change how to assign the different types of structures, make it better visible. Other than that the visualization was nice to see everything immediatly in 3d
