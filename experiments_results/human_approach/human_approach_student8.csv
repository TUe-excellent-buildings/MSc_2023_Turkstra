16:35:31;4;How satisfied were you with the overall design process you experienced?;Overall it went fine I think. It was a little bit hard to understand the assignment. The interface was good and clear. But it would be helpfull to have the numbers of rectangles in the building itself.

16:36:09;4;How easy was it to use the design tools provided?;It was very easy. The only annoying this was that the buildign was upside down when you try to rotate.

16:36:59;3;How satisfied are you with the design decisions you made?;I perhaps not have made a stable structure haha. But overall it was quite fine I think.

16:38:29;0;How do you think having AI assistance would have changed your design process?;It would have helped a lot I think! When you have suggestions what to do makes it a lot easier.

16:39:36;0;Would you choose to use this design process in future projects based on your current experience?;Perhaps, but I dont think so. I think it also depends on the customer and the financial aspects and such to make a structural design. And to what the client and the architect want.
