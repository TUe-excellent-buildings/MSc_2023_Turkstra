16:49:20;3;How satisfied were you with the overall design process you experienced?;Since I did not really now what splitting and deleting would mean, I would have liked a third iteration so I could have made these decisions based on something

16:49:20;2;Entered Screen;10
16:50:06;2;How easy was it to use the design tools provided?;It was quite difficult to find the correct switch for each wall. But it also did not help that I changed my mind constantly and needed to go back everytime.

16:50:37;3;How satisfied are you with the design decisions you made?;Could have been a lot better, but it could also have been a lot worse.

16:51:45;0;How do you think having AI assistance would have changed your design process?;I think it would have helped, because I could for example let it generate a design that is structurally stable with at much windows as possible, which I would have liked. The only think you have to do then is check whether it is correct, instead of coming up with the design yourself

16:52:12;0;Would you choose to use this design process in future projects based on your current experience?;The iterations are nice, maybe if I new in advance what the effect of my choices would have been.

16:52:50;0;Please provide any additional comments or suggestions on how we could improve the design process used in this experiment.;It would have been nice to clearly indicate which switch is for which panel, for indecisive people like me.
