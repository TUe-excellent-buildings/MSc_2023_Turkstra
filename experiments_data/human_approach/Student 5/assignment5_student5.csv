16:39:58;2;How satisfied were you with the overall design process you experienced?;Overall, I liked the concept of the assignment. It was nice to think about how to make this building stable. But working with the program could have been better. When asigning the three types of walls to the rectangles. The Green model of the building, with the volumes was not visable anymore. Therefore I forgat where I could place walls. What also was incovient, is that there were 50 rectangles that had to be assigned, and there wasnt an indication which number was which wall. So, when you wanted to make a truss at a location, you had to click every one of them to find the wall you were looking for. This took some time. Numbers at the walls would have been nice.

16:42:36;3;How satisfied are you with the design decisions you made?;At the first one. I found out at the end that I couldnt place a truss at a place I wanted because it was inside a volume, but I didnt know that it was a volume, because the green picture was not there anymore. And to go over every of the 50 numbers again to change it, would have taken a lot of time. also  to figer out which number coresponds to which rectangle.
