# Code used for design response grammar pubication
This directory contains some of the code used in the following publication:

Boonstra, S., Blom, K. van der, Hofmeyer, H., and Emmerich, M. T. M. "Hybridization of Evolutionary Algorithms and Simulations of Co-evolutionary Design Processes for Building Spatial Design Optimization". In: (Submitted to Automation in Construction) (2020), pp. 1-19

Note that the code related to the evolutionary algorithm is not published in this directory.
The following code is included in this directory:

* an executable that can carry out the SCDP with performance clusters on a building spatial design
* an executable that can carry out the SCDP with boundary spaces on a building spatial design 

Furthermore the following supplementary data is supplied:

* the building spatial designs used for the case studies
* the settings (structural and thermal design) used for the case studies

## Reproducibility
Note that the code has been updated since the publication, and that some results may possibly not be reproduced with the latest version of the toolbox.
The studies in the publication have been carried out using v1.0 of the toolbox.
In case the reader cannot reproduce the exact results, he/she is advised to contact an admin of the toolbox.
